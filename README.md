# 21 MERN: Book Search Engine

## Your Task

Your assignment this week is emblematic of the fact that most modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. This shouldn't come as a surprise, as the ability to personalize user data is the cornerstone of real-world web development today. And as user demands evolve, applications need to be more performant.

This week, youâ€™ll take starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end. 


## User Story

```md
AS AN avid reader
I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase
```


## Mock-Up

Let's start by revisiting the web application's appearance and functionality.

As you can see in the following animation, a user can type a search term (in this case, "star wars") in a search box and the results appear:
